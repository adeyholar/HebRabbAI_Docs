## Environment and Tooling Issues (August 16, 2025)
- Encountered `pip install logging` error due to attempting to install a third-party package conflicting with the built-in `logging` module.
- Resolved by using the built-in `logging` module; enhanced with `loguru` (installed via `pip install loguru`) for debugging.
- Updated `audio_indexer.py` to include logging for indexing process monitoring.
## Audio Indexing Execution (August 16, 2025, 19:27:48)
- Indexed 39 books successfully, including single-chapter (Obadiah) and multi-chapter (Psalms: 150).
- Resolved false "missing book" warnings by aligning audio names with `hebrew_bible_with_nikkud.json` abbreviations (e.g., "Genesis" â†’ "Gen").
- Validation now sorts chapters; check `audio_indexing.log` for mismatches.
